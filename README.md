# Image Enhancement Using CNN

The method of image enhancement is crucial in the field of computer vision and 
image processing. Image enhancement techniques are used to enhance details, reduce 
noise, and fix flaws in photographs to improve their visual quality. A subset of deep 
learning algorithms called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be 
particularly adept at tasks requiring image improvement. In order to shed light on its 
goals, processes, potential uses, and anticipated results, this study sets out to 
investigate the broad range of picture improvement utilizing CNNs. 
In recent years, deep learning approaches, particularly CNNs, have revolutionized 
the field of  image enhancement. CNNs are well-suited for this task due to their 
ability to automatically learn features and representations directly from data, 
making them capable of capturing complex relationships within images and 
generating high-quality enhancements. This has sparked significant interest in the 
development of CNN-based models for image enhancement. The main goal of 
image improvement with CNNs is to turn digital photographs captured in low-light 
situations into visually appealing, educational, and noise-free representations. 

## LOL Dataset

The LOL (Low-Light) dataset is designed for low-light image enhancement tasks. It consists of paired images, where each low-light image has a corresponding well-lit version, enabling supervised learning for brightness correction and noise reduction. The dataset is commonly used in deep learning-based image enhancement models, helping improve visibility in dark environments for applications like nighttime photography, surveillance, and autonomous driving.
